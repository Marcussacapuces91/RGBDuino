# RGBDuino
"RGBDuino UNO compatible board designed and developed specialy for students to learn coding using a microcontroller. We named it RGBDuino UNO to encourage everyone to be a maker by getting started with this amazing board." 

The original repository did not however contain any schematics nor hardware details, bom lists or details to help makers.
This fork tries to change that. Either by reverse engineering or getting them to release the required files.

## Features
* Atmel ATmega328P microcontroller (As used on original Arduino UNO)
* Input USB 5V
* 500mA (Max) 3.3V Voltage regulator
* 10 blue leds and 2 RGB programable leds.
* Micro usb for power and programming using
* WCH CH341, USB to serial ic with speeds from 50bps to 2Mpbs, supporting 5v and 3.3v.
* Buzzer for "music"
* 1 programmable button (aka, user Input to be defined)
* 1 reset button
* A cute Duck or awesome Makergirl design printed on the PCB

## Important Pin assignments

Pin D9 is connected to the signal pin of the buzzer module
Or, according to PDF, pin 8. Switch the buzzer to off, to use pin8 for different things.
Pin 12 and Pin 13 are connected to the two RGB led.
Pin2 should be the user button (next to reset, be carefull) Its the one close to the header,
reset is to the outside of the board.

# Examples

# Schematic 

After email contact with seller on Aliexpress, Miss C. Chan send me sch.pdf. 
The apparently Altium designer made schematics in PDF format. 
Creation date: 20200910

## Buzzer test
Included is an empty text file, the title seems to be in Thai and reads:
``How do you know?`` (``ทไร๙ฦ๗ฒโสิด๚ย๋.txt``)
or ``What is 9? 7?``


# Drivers for the serial device

The original included driver package did not seem to be from the original hardware manufacturer, as such, its been deleted.
Users are adviced to see if drivers for the WCH CH341 are automaticly installed (By Windows or Linux) or find a solution, drivers on the following website:
http://wch-ic.com/search?q=CH341&t=downloads

# Backup of original firmware
A backup has been made using the following command with extra verbosity.
also backups from eeprom and fuses can be found. It is not expected those to be in any special condition.
(also odd the eeprom contains the first bit from flash?)

```bash
$ avrdude -c arduino -D -P /dev/ttyUSB0 -n -p m328p -v -v -v -Uflash:r:flash.hex:i
```
Its output:
```bash
